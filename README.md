Distributed Systems â€“ Actor Model in Elixir
 	Twitter Engine: Implemented a Twitter Engine using ETS storage and the GenServer-Supervisor architecture to simulate the processes of registering and authenticating accounts, tweeting, retweeting, mentioning, tagging, querying and displaying live feeds for users. Used a Web Interface using Phoenix to display the full simulation on a web browser   
 	Gossip Algorithms: Determined the convergence time of Gossip Algorithms used for group communication and aggregate computation through a simulator based on the actor model in Elixir, defining worker actors that operate asynchronously. Established communication for the following network topologies: Full, Line, Random 2d grid, 3d torus grid, Honeycomb, and Honeycomb with random neighbors 
 	Tapestry P2P Network: Implemented the Tapestry Algorithm that is used to provide an object access service in an overlay P2P network and uses distributed hash tables by incorporating back pointers to copies of object replicas, thereby minimizing the number of hops
