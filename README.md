# DistributedSystems
Distributed Systems using the Actor Model in Elixir
1. Determined the convergence time of Gossip Algorithms used for group communication and aggregate computation through a simulator based on the actor model in Elixir, defining worker actors that operate asynchronously. Established communication for the following network topologies: Full, Line, Random 2d grid, 3d torus grid, Honeycomb, and Honeycomb with random neighbors
2. Implemented the Tapestry Algorithm that is used to provide an object access service in an overlay P2P network and uses distributed hash tables by incorporating back pointers to copies of object replicas, thereby minimizing the number of hops
