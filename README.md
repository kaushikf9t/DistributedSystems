# DistributedSystems
Distributed Systems using the Actor Model in Elixir
1. Used the Actor Model in elixir to check for vampire numbers between a large range of numbers(1billion - 2 billion)
2. Implementation of Gossip Algorithms used for group communication and aggregate computation through a simulator based on the actor model in Elixir, defining worker actors that operate asynchronously. Established communication for the following network topologies: Full, Line, Random 2d grid, 3d torus grid, Honeycomb, and Honeycomb with random neighbors
